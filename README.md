# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

`Binary Classification Problem`
`Logistic Regression Model`

Building a system in Python that can predict whether the object is a Rock or a Mine based on the [Sonar Data](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqblBfQVlvZ2g0TXJoNjE2TkJxd0x1eTBnTjJsUXxBQ3Jtc0trWXFfQ0x1ajEybEhUUHo2aFpzb1hZY3Q5eDBrSHRUTTVWaHV5S2x6TWpadi12cXFTQ0ppYWJ1MW5kbFhsc1hWaHR0V1ZEU1NRdkNQQ1ZscENDc1hjNkN5eGpHaTUwTE5iaFBDZEt0YVF0TG9WYWwxNA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1pQxtljlNVh0DHYg-Ye7dtpDTlFceHVfa%2Fview%3Fusp%3Ddrivesdk&v=fiz1ORTBGpY).
For prediction Supervised Machine Learning Model is used and executed in Jupyter Notebook using Python. Here, Logistic Regression Model is adopted as it is most accurate for Binary Classification problem.
Model is trained for 70% of dataset and tested for 30% of dataset. Accuracy Score obtained for the test dataset was 77.78%.


This model can be used for predicting a Rock or a Mine by just entering the input Sonar Data.
